      <h3>ASPIRATION IN LIFE.</h3>

      <P>
        My most important aspiration is to be a faithful ambassador of my faith, anywhere, any day, and anytime.
Secondly, affect my generation positively by serving them with my gifts and potential.
Thirdly, becoming a well sought-after software engineer, building and delivering digital products that not only solve our different daily problems and challenges, but also products that will bring glory to the kingdom for which I represent here on earth, heaven...  

      </P>
